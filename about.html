        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Abhinnav Abbu â€” a 19-year-old filmmaker, video editor, and tech enthusiast currently in my first year at Ashoka University, where I'm studying Economics and Computer Science. I've spent the last decade behind the camera and at the editing desk, creating stories that move people. With six short films under my belt and a win at an intercollegiate filmmaking competition, I blend creativity with precision. Whether it's crafting cinematic narratives or exploring the latest in tech, I'm always chasing the next big idea.
